This project provides a way to run browser based tests on a contuous integration server like Hudson.  

There are several browser based testing frameworks out there.  For example:
- jspec
- qunit
- sproutcore's testrunner

The most functional way of using these frameworks is to open a browser and point it at a testing page configured for the framework.
But that isn't easy to integrate with continuous integegration server, because it wants a summary of the tests that it can save with the 
build and report on.

Capybara provides a way to make this work in a generic way for these testing frameworks.  It can launch a webbrowser pointed at the 
testing page, and then introspect the page and its javascript objects to get the results.  

An alternative approach to running tests this way is to is to use env.js with rhino.  Or to use HTMLUnit.  However since that isn't running a real browser with full dom and css rendering there will always be something you can't full test.
